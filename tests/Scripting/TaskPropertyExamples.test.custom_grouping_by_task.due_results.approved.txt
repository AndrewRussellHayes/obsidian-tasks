group by function task.due.formatAsDateAndTime()
Format date as YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm or empty string if no due date.
Note:
    This is shown for demonstration purposes.
    Currently the Tasks plugin does not support storing of times.
    Do not add times to your tasks, as it will break the reading of task data

group by function task.due.format("YYYY[%%]-MM[%%] MMM", "no due date")
Group by month, for example `2023%%-05%% May` ...
    ... which gets rendered by Obsidian as `2023 May`.
Or show a default heading "no due date" if no date.
The hidden month number is added, commented-out between two `%%` strings, to control the sort order of headings.
To escape characters in format strings, you can wrap the characters in square brackets (here, `[%%]`)
=>
2023%%-05%% May
2023%%-06%% Jun
Invalid date
no due date
====================================================================================


group by function task.due.format("YYYY[%%]-MM[%%] MMM [- Week] WW")
Group by month and week number, for example `2023%%-05%% May - Week 22` ...
    ... which gets rendered by Obsidian as `2023 May - Week 22`.
If the month number is not embedded, in some years the first or last week of the year is displayed in a non-logical order.
=>
2023%%-05%% May - Week 22
2023%%-06%% Jun - Week 22
Invalid date

group by function task.due.moment?.fromNow() || ""
Group by the time from now, for example "8 days ago".
Because Moment.fromNow() is not provided by TasksDate, we need special code for when there is no date value.
Whilst interesting, the alphabetical sort order makes the headings a little hard to read
=>
10 days ago
11 days ago
12 days ago
Invalid date
